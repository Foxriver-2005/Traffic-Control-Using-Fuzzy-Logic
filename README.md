# Traffic-Control-Using-Fuzzy-Logic
Fuzzy Logic – A form of knowledge representation suitable for notions that cannot be defined precisely.
Fuzzy logic Operators
    • AND
    • OR
    • NOT
    • IMPLIES

Steps to Design a Fuzzy Logic Control System
    (1) Identify the principal input, output and process stacks.
    (2) Identify linguistics variables used and define fuzzy sets and membership.
    (3) Form procedural rules.
    (4) Determine the defuzzification method.
    (5) Test the system and modify if necessary.
    
 For this project is it mandatory that you install "Fuzzy logic designer". To do so open matlab, go to home, then click on "ad-ons" then search for "fuzzy logic toolbox" and click install
